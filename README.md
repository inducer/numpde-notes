# Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

Slides/notes and Jupyter notebook demos for an introductory course of numerical
methods for PDEs.

Originally developed for [CS555 in the spring of 2020](https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/course/cs555-s20/)
in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/)
at the [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/), based on prior versions of the
class taught by Luke Olson.

-   [PDF](https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/cs555-s20/notes.pdf) of these slides/notes (see `notes`
    for source)

-   [Demos](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inducer/numpde-notes/main?filepath=demos)
    in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

-   The demos use annotations for [`ipython-demo-tools`](https://github.com/inducer/ipython-demo-tools).
    A `#clear` annotation at the beginning of a code cell allows the
    `clear-marked-inputs` subcommand of
    [`prepare-ipynb`](https://github.com/inducer/ipython-demo-tools/blob/main/prepare-ipynb) 
    to remove the content of those input cells, maybe to use them for live coding in class.
    The `#clear` marks themselves can be removed by that `remove-marks` subcommand.

-   The notes are written in [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/), which serves as a lightweight
    markup language over LaTeX. They're easiest to edit in Emacs, but
    [vim-orgmode](https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode) will do as well.

    To build the notes, you need any recent version of Emacs installed. Also make sure that
    submodules cloned properly:
    ```
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    Then simply change to the `notes` subdirectory and say:
    ```
    ./make.sh
    ```
    The script will optionally make use of [`latexrun`](https://github.com/cjoach/latexrun).
    If you get
    ```
    There were errors; output not updated
    ```
    on the first go, simply rerun `make.sh`.

-   `make.sh` will generate two PDFs: `notes.pdf` and `notes-folded.pdf`.
    They differ in whether the boxes present in the notes (containing many
    of the most salient mathematical developments) are filled in or not.

    I use the un-filled version for class and fill in the boxes by hand
    during class using [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/)
    (but equivalent notetaking applications should work just as well).

-   If you can demonstrate that you are teaching a related course
    at a college or university anywhere in the world, I have
    homework assignments and projects (some of which are autograded
    using the [RELATE](https://github.com/inducer/relate/) system)
    that I would be happy to share with you.
